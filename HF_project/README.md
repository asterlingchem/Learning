# Hartree Fock code for H2 with STO-3G and 6-31G basis sets

Hartree Fock code, using the 'Nickel and Copper' Youtube video series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDAfpQIMde0)
and Szabo and Ostlund.

This is not good code, nor is it a good way of implementing HF, but it served its purpose as a tool to understand the principles of HF theory and how to convert theory into code.
